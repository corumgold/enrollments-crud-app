# Enrollments CRUD Application

This project is designed to mimic the interface of an application that manages different school campuses as well as the students enrolled.

Key Features:

<ul>
<li>Create, Read, Update, and Delete campuses/students</li>
<li>Intuitive, mobile-friendly interface</li>
<li>Sort students/campuses by enrollment status</li>
<li>Precise form validation</li>
<li>Addresses link to Google Maps for driving directions</li>
</ul>

Fun fact: Each of the campuses listed in the seed file is an actual
school that I have attended!
